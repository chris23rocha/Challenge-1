## Lessons Learned

During this project I learned how to rewrite and restructure inefficient code to offer more accessibility. During the process the biggest issue i had was finding out which lines of .css could be simplified or shortened using semantic elements. I overcame this by reading more info through w3schools and applying it to the challenge.
